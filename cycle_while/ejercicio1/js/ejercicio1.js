/*
  name exercice: Calculate force using Newton's second law.
  description: Request a mass (m) and acceleration (a) and calculate the force (F)
  by applying the formula: F=mÃ—aF = m \times a. Additional conditions: The total 
  sum of all calculated forces must be accumulated, and the number of calculations 
  performed must be counted. The program ends when the user enters a negative mass 
  or acceleration.
